Abstract
========
An automated intelligence system designed to monitor and analyze government customs auctions (e.g., Mexico's "Subastas de Aduana" via INDEP). The system utilizes a multi-portal ingestion engine to capture listings of abandoned or seized merchandise (lots) across various customs points. A technical categorization engine utilizes NLP and image recognition to identify high-value goods (e.g., Industrial Machinery, Electronics, Specialized Raw Materials) within mixed lots. The system features a "Market Value Estimator" that cross-references lot descriptions with international wholesale prices (e.g., Alibaba, eBay) to identify high-margin bidding opportunities. By providing a unified, searchable dashboard for ephemeral auction data, the system enables importers and liquidators to capitalize on seized assets with data-driven bidding strategies.

Technical Field
===============
This disclosure relates to the field of Logistics, International Trade, and automated auction monitoring systems for distressed merchandise.

Background & Problem Statement
==============================
Customs authorities frequently auction off "Abandoned Goods"—merchandise that was never claimed or was seized due to tax/legal issues. These auctions (often managed by agencies like INDEP in Mexico) offer items at a fraction of their market value. However, the descriptions are often vague ("Mixed Lot of 50 boxes"), and the auctions are only live for a few days. For professional liquidators, identifying which lot contains valuable industrial parts vs. junk is a manual and risky process. There is a need for a system that "shines a light" on these auctions through automated data enrichment.

Detailed Description
====================


Specific Embodiments
====================
In one embodiment, the system includes a "Port Logistics Calculator" that estimates the cost of transporting the won lot from the specific customs point (e.g., Tijuana vs. Veracruz) to the user's warehouse, providing a true "Landed Cost" estimate.

Claims of Novelty
=================
The system claims novelty in the application of automated metadata enrichment and wholesale price cross-referencing specifically to the domain of government customs auctions, enabling the identification of high-value industrial assets within unstructured or vague auction listings.
