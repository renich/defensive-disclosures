Abstract
========
An automated search and discovery system designed for the identification of specialized vehicle parts in fragmented salvage markets (e.g., "Yonkes" or scrapyards). The system utilize a distributed ingestion engine to monitor digital inventories from individual scrapyards, social media "Part-Out" groups, and specialized salvage marketplaces. A semantic search layer employs fuzzy matching and cross-referencing of OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) part numbers to identify compatible components across different vehicle makes and years. The system features a "Real-Time Availability Checker" that utilizes instant messaging bots to query "Analog" scrapyards (those without digital inventory) through automated text requests. By centralizing access to ephemeral salvage inventory, the system enables repair shops and individual owners to find rare or discontinued parts with high efficiency.

Technical Field
===============
This disclosure relates to the field of Automotive Logistics, automated inventory search, and e-commerce for specialized salvage assets.

Background & Problem Statement
==============================
Finding a specific part for an older or rare vehicle is a major challenge. While new parts are available via structured catalogs, the used/salvage market is highly fragmented. Many "Yonkes" have no digital inventory, or they only post sporadic updates on Facebook. A mechanic might spend hours calling 10 different yards to find a specific "2005 Ford F-150 Transmission." This information gap leads to long repair delays and unnecessary spending on new parts when a perfectly functional salvaged one exists nearby.

Detailed Description
====================


Specific Embodiments
====================
In one embodiment, the system includes a "Reputation & Guarantee" tracker that logs which yard owners provide accurate parts and honor their return policies, creating a "Trust Layer" in the traditionally informal salvage market.

Claims of Novelty
=================
The system claims novelty in the combination of multi-source salvage scraping with an automated messaging-based "Analog Query" system and OEM compatibility mapping to centralize the search for fragmented vehicle components.
