Abstract
========
An automated geospatial intelligence system designed to map and verify fiber optic internet coverage (e.g., Totalplay, Telmex, Izzi) at a hyper-local level. The system utilize a distributed network of "Coverage Checkers" that programmatically query ISP availability portals using a database of street-level addresses. A GIS (Geographic Information System) engine aggregates these individual results into "Heatmaps" that identify newly deployed infrastructure and underserved regions. The system features a "Sales Lead Generator" that identifies neighborhoods where new high-speed coverage has just become available, providing ISP sales teams and independent resellers with high-intent target lists. By providing a real-time, cross-provider view of digital infrastructure, the system reduces the information gap between ISP network deployment and consumer acquisition.

Technical Field
===============
This disclosure relates to the field of Telecommunications Technology (TeleTech), Geographic Information Systems (GIS), and automated market intelligence.

Background & Problem Statement
==============================
ISP coverage maps are notoriously inaccurate or outdated. A consumer might be told "No coverage" for their house while their neighbor across the street has fiber. For internet sales teams, knowing *exactly* where a new fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) line has been laid is a major competitive advantage. However, manually checking every address on a map is impossible. There is a need for a system that "probes" ISP portals at scale to generate an independent, high-resolution map of actual infrastructure availability.

Detailed Description
====================


Specific Embodiments
====================
In one embodiment, the system includes a "Speed-Test Correlator" that ingests public crowdsourced speed-test data to verify if the "Available" fiber is actually delivering the advertised gigabit speeds in a specific neighborhood.

Claims of Novelty
=================
The system claims novelty in the combination of large-scale automated ISP portal probing with GIS-based polygon generation for the specific purpose of identifying newly deployed fiber optic infrastructure for sales intelligence.
