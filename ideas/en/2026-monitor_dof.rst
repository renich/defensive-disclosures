Abstract
========
An automated regulatory intelligence system designed to monitor official government gazettes (e.g., Mexico's "Diario Oficial de la Federación" - DOF) and deliver sector-specific alerts. The system comprises a high-frequency scraper that captures daily publications, an NLP-based categorization engine, and a personalized notification dispatcher. Unlike standard search tools, the system employs a semantic ontology to identify how legislative changes—such as new tariff codes, labor regulations, or environmental standards—specifically impact pre-defined business sectors. The system extracts effective dates and transition periods, generating a "Compliance Impact Summary" for legal and accounting departments. This ensures that enterprises remain updated on high-impact regulatory shifts without the need for manual daily review of voluminous legal text.

Technical Field
===============
This disclosure relates to the field of Legal Informatics (LegalTech), automated document classification, and regulatory monitoring systems.

Background & Problem Statement
==============================
The "Diario Oficial de la Federación" (DOF) is the primary vehicle for making new laws and regulations legally binding in Mexico. It often contains hundreds of pages of technical and legal text daily. For businesses in highly regulated sectors (e.g., Energy, Pharma, Finance), missing a single decree or a change in a "Norma Oficial Mexicana" (NOM) can result in non-compliance and heavy fines. Conventional "keyword alerts" often generate excessive noise, as they cannot distinguish between a minor administrative mention and a major legislative overhaul.

Detailed Description
====================


Specific Embodiments
====================
In one embodiment, the system includes a "Historical Precedent Search" that allows users to query how a specific law has evolved over time by aggregating historical DOF publications into a searchable vector database.

Claims of Novelty
=================
The system claims novelty in its application of semantic sector-specific filtering to official government gazettes, providing an automated bridge between raw legislative data and actionable business intelligence, specifically focusing on the extraction of temporal constraints and regulatory impact levels.
