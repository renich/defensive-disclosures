Abstract
========
An automated intelligence system designed to discover and categorize academic scholarships and research funding opportunities. The system utilizes a multi-portal ingestion engine to monitor government grant portals (e.g., CONAHCYT in Mexico), university scholarship pages, and private foundation announcements. A semantic analysis layer employs NLP to extract critical metadata from unstructured calls for proposals (Convocatorias), including eligibility criteria, funding amounts, deadline dates, and required documentation. The system features a "Candidate Matching Engine" that cross-references identified opportunities against a user's academic profile (field of study, GPA, research interests). By automating the identification of relevant funding sources, the system enables students and researchers to focus on their technical work while ensuring they never miss a viable financial support opportunity.

Technical Field
===============
This disclosure relates to the field of Education Technology (EdTech), automated document parsing, and grant-tracking systems.

Background & Problem Statement
==============================
Finding funding for education or research is a highly fragmented process. Opportunities are scattered across hundreds of government websites, international foundations, and individual university departments. Many scholarship calls are only published for a few weeks and have extremely specific requirements (e.g., "Engineering students from Jalisco with a focus on robotics"). For busy researchers or students, the time required to "hunt" for these grants is a significant barrier. There is a need for an automated "Scout" that provides a personalized feed of relevant opportunities.

Detailed Description
====================


Specific Embodiments
====================
In one embodiment, the system includes a "Document Checklist Assistant" that, once a user selects a grant, automatically generates a list of required documents (e.g., "Birth Certificate," "Transcript") and provides a workflow to track their collection and submission.

Claims of Novelty
=================
The system claims novelty in the application of specialized NLP entity extraction to the domain of academic funding "Convocatorias," combined with a profile-based semantic matching engine to automate the end-to-end grant discovery lifecycle.
