Abstract
========
An automated email management system designed to achieve "Inbox Zero" through semantic triage and multi-dimensional classification. The system utilizes IMAP/API connectors to ingest incoming emails in real-time. A Large Language Model (LLM) analyzer evaluates each message's intent, urgency, and technical category (e.g., "Invoice," "Sales Inquiry," "Internal Task," "Spam"). Based on pre-defined executive rules, the system performs automated actions: filing invoices into accounting folders, drafting suggested replies for common inquiries, and summarizing long threads into executive briefs. The system features a "Priority Gatekeeper" that only alerts the user for high-urgency/high-value messages, significantly reducing cognitive load and administrative overhead for corporate leadership.

Technical Field
===============
This disclosure relates to the field of Information Management, Personal Assistant Technology, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) for communication.

Background & Problem Statement
==============================
Executive leadership often receives hundreds of emails daily. A significant portion of this volume consists of low-value notifications, BCC threads, or routine requests that do not require immediate attention. Standard email filters (by sender or keyword) are too blunt to handle complex semantic contexts. This results in "Email Fatigue," where critical messages are buried under a mountain of administrative noise. There is a need for a system that can "understand" the value of an email and handle the routine aspects of communication automatically.

Detailed Description
====================


Specific Embodiments
====================
In one embodiment, the system includes a "Newsletter Digest" feature that captures all promotional and educational emails, summarizes them into a single weekly PDF report, and deletes the originals, keeping the primary inbox free of clutter.

Claims of Novelty
=================
The system claims novelty in the application of LLM-based semantic triage to the specific workflow of executive communication, combined with automated attachment handling and urgency-based cross-platform alerting to achieve an automated "Inbox Zero."
