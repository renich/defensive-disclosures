Abstract
========
An automated procurement intelligence system designed to monitor government tender portals (e.g., Mexico's Compranet) and automate the initial stages of technical proposal drafting. The system features a multi-source scraper that identifies new bidding opportunities, an LLM-based "Opportunity Scorer" that evaluates tender requirements against a company's past performance and capabilities, and a document generation engine. The engine parses complex tender specifications (Anexos Técnicos) and automatically populates draft response templates with relevant technical descriptions, certifications, and compliance statements. By reducing the time required to identify and respond to government contracts, the system enables enterprises to compete for a higher volume of opportunities while maintaining high standards of technical accuracy in their submissions.

Technical Field
===============
This disclosure relates to the field of Business Intelligence (BI), automated document generation, and government procurement software (GovTech).

Background & Problem Statement
==============================
Government bidding processes (licitaciones) are notoriously complex. Portals like Compranet often have poor user interfaces, making it difficult to find relevant opportunities. Once found, companies have very short windows to review hundreds of pages of requirements and draft a "Propuesta Técnica." For many businesses, the administrative overhead of bidding is so high that they miss out on profitable contracts. There is a need for a system that filters noise and provides a "head start" in the technical documentation process.

Detailed Description
====================


Specific Embodiments
====================
In one embodiment, the system includes a "Competitor Intelligence" module that analyzes historical Compranet data to predict which companies are likely to bid and what their historical pricing strategy has been for similar contracts.

Claims of Novelty
=================
The system claims novelty in the application of RAG-based document generation to the specific domain of government tender response drafting, combined with an automated requirement-to-capability matching engine designed to reduce the barrier to entry for public procurement.
