Abstract
========
An automated geospatial monitoring system designed to track transitions in agrarian property rights, specifically the conversion from communal ("Ejidal") to private property ("Dominio Pleno"). The system interfaces with public records from the National Agrarian Registry (RAN) and agrarian court gazettes to identify parcels entering the privatization pipeline. By combining land-use satellite imagery with legal status updates, the system identifies high-value "Scout" opportunities for real estate development in emerging zones. The system features a "Conflict Risk Classifier" that identifies parcels with unresolved agrarian litigation, protecting investors from long-term legal encumbrances. This provides a technical bridge to access information that is traditionally difficult to retrieve and interpret, enabling data-driven acquisition of developing land.

Technical Field
===============
This disclosure relates to the field of Real Estate Technology (PropTech), Geographic Information Systems (GIS), and automated legal monitoring for land development.

Background & Problem Statement
==============================
A large percentage of land in Mexico is held under the "Ejido" system (communal ownership). This land cannot be sold as private property until it goes through a specific legal process called "Dominio Pleno." Identifying which "Ejidos" are voting to privatize their land is a major advantage for developers, as the land is significantly cheaper before the title is finalized. However, RAN records are notoriously difficult to access digitally, and the process is opaque. There is a need for a system that "scouts" these legal transitions automatically to identify investment frontiers.

Detailed Description
====================


Specific Embodiments
====================
In one embodiment, the system utilizes NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) data from satellites to monitor if an "Ejidal" parcel is being cleared of vegetation, which often precedes the formal legal request for privatization, providing a "Pre-Legal" signal of development.

Claims of Novelty
=================
The system claims novelty in the combination of automated agrarian legal status monitoring (RAN scraping) with satellite-based land-use analysis to predict and track the transition of communal land into private real estate markets.
