Abstract
========
An automated procurement system designed to optimize material purchasing for construction and industrial projects. The system features a multi-source scraper that monitors real-time pricing for building materials (e.g., cement, steel, lumber) across major national retailers (e.g., Home Depot, Lowe's) and local specialized distributors. A "BOM (Bill of Materials) Analyzer" parses project spreadsheets to identify required quantities and specifications. The core optimization engine calculates the "Minimum Cost Procurement Plan" by comparing bulk pricing, delivery costs, and stock availability across all vendors. The system generates a consolidated purchase list, identifying the specific vendor for each item to achieve maximum savings. This provides a technical solution for reducing project overhead through automated, high-frequency price arbitrage in the fragmented construction supply market.

Technical Field
===============
This disclosure relates to the field of Construction Technology (ConTech), automated procurement, and supply chain price optimization.

Background & Problem Statement
==============================
Material costs represent up to 60% of a construction project's budget. Prices for items like rebar or cement fluctuate daily and vary significantly between a large retailer and a local neighborhood ferretería. Project managers traditionally spend hours calling suppliers or checking websites to find the best deal. For large BOMs with hundreds of items, it is manually impossible to find the globally optimal purchasing strategy that accounts for both the item price and the delivery fees from multiple locations.

Detailed Description
====================


Specific Embodiments
====================
In one embodiment, the system includes a "Group Buying" feature that aggregates the BOMs of multiple small contractors in the same city to unlock "Volume Discounts" from large manufacturers that would be inaccessible to them individually.

Claims of Novelty
=================
The system claims novelty in the application of a logistics-aware optimization engine to the specific domain of construction materials, combined with a multi-source scraper that bridges the gap between large national retailers and small local distributors.
