Abstract
========
An automated sentiment analysis system designed for the hyper-local monitoring of political perception and public opinion. The system utilizes a multi-platform ingestion layer to capture social media interactions (e.g., Twitter/X, Facebook, Instagram) filtered by specific geographic boundaries (municipal or neighborhood level). A semantic analysis engine employs Large Language Models (LLMs) to categorize public discourse into specific themes (e.g., "Security," "Public Lighting," "Corruption") and evaluate the sentiment polarity toward specific political figures or policies. The system features a "Bot & Astroturfing Detector" that filters out inorganic interactions, providing a purified view of actual citizen sentiment. By generating real-time "Perception Maps," the system enables candidates and public officials to identify emerging local crises and optimize their communication strategies with data-driven precision.

Technical Field
===============
This disclosure relates to the field of Social Listening, Political Technology (PolTech), and automated Natural Language Processing (NLP) for public opinion analysis.

Background & Problem Statement
==============================
Traditional political polling is slow, expensive, and often fails to capture "micro-trends" at the municipal level. Furthermore, political discourse on social media is often distorted by "Astroturfing"—coordinated attacks by bots or paid influencers. For local political campaigns, understanding what citizens in a specific neighborhood are actually complaining about (e.g., a specific pothole or a recent crime spike) is critical for effective campaigning. There is a need for a system that can monitor these conversations 24/7, filter out the noise, and provide an accurate "Pulse" of the local electorate.

Detailed Description
====================


Specific Embodiments
====================
In one embodiment, the system includes a "Predictive Perception Model" that uses historical sentiment data to forecast how a specific policy announcement (e.g., a new property tax) is likely to be received by different demographic segments of the local population.

Claims of Novelty
=================
The system claims novelty in the application of hyper-local geographic filtering combined with LLM-based theme classification and automated bot detection for the specific purpose of generating real-time political perception maps for municipal-level governance and campaigning.
