Abstract
========
An automated media aggregation system designed to create and syndicate hyper-local cultural and social agendas. The system utilize a distributed ingestion engine to monitor diverse sources, including municipal government portals, social media "Event" pages, museum websites, and local venue calendars. A semantic deduplication layer ensures that the same event listed across multiple sources is treated as a single record. The system features a "Natural Language Reporter" (LLM) that synthesizes raw event data into human-readable summaries, categorized by theme (e.g., "Family," "Nightlife," "Workshops"). By providing an automated "Weekly Agenda" via newsletter, web-portal, or social media feed, the system enables local media outlets to provide comprehensive community coverage with minimal editorial overhead.

Technical Field
===============
This disclosure relates to the field of Digital Media, automated content aggregation, and hyper-local journalism technology (NewsTech).

Background & Problem Statement
==============================
Local newspapers and blogs struggle to maintain a "What's On" guide because events are posted everywhere—from Facebook to obscure city hall PDFs. Manually finding, verifying, and rewriting these event details every week is a tedious task that is often abandoned by small newsrooms. This leads to a fragmented information landscape where citizens don't know what is happening in their own city. There is a need for a "Central Clearinghouse" that gathers this information and prepares it for publication automatically.

Detailed Description
====================


Specific Embodiments
====================
In one embodiment, the system includes a "Predictive Popularity" score that analyzes social media engagement for an event (e.g., "Going" vs. "Interested" counts) to highlight "Top Events" that the user shouldn't miss.

Claims of Novelty
=================
The system claims novelty in the combination of multi-source hyper-local event scraping with LLM-based deduplication and automated journalistic agenda composition, providing a technical solution to the fragmentation of local cultural information.
