Abstract
========
A dynamic pricing and market intelligence system designed for short-term rental properties (e.g., Airbnb/VRBO) in specific geographic niches (e.g., Ajijic/Chapala). The system utilizes a specialized crawler to monitor competitor availability calendars and pricing tiers in real-time. By applying a supply-demand elasticity model, the system identifies periods of high local occupancy (e.g., local festivals, seasonal migrations) and suggests price adjustments to maximize revenue per available room (RevPAR). The system also features a "Competitor Sentiment" analyzer that parses reviews to identify common service failures in a specific area, allowing the user to optimize their property's technical and service offerings.

Technical Field
===============
This disclosure relates to the field of Hospitality Technology, dynamic pricing algorithms, and short-term rental market analysis.

Background & Problem Statement
==============================
The short-term rental market is highly volatile, especially in "expatriate" or "weekend" niches like the Lake Chapala area. Standard pricing tools often use global data that fails to capture hyper-local events (e.g., a specific local "Fiesta" that doubles demand). Property owners often "set and forget" their prices, losing significant revenue during peak demand or suffering from low occupancy due to overpricing during minor lulls. There is a need for a tool that focuses on the hyper-local "competitor set" to drive data-based pricing decisions.

Detailed Description
====================


Specific Embodiments
====================
In one embodiment, the system integrates with IoT sensors (smart locks/noise monitors) to correlate actual occupancy with the pricing data, providing a unified dashboard for property operations and financial performance.

Claims of Novelty
=================
The system claims novelty in its focus on hyper-local "Micro-Niche" occupancy tracking and its combination of competitor calendar scraping with NLP-based review sentiment analysis to drive both pricing and service-level optimizations in the short-term rental market.
