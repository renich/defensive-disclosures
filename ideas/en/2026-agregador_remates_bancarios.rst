Abstract
========
A centralized data aggregation and analysis system designed for the identification and evaluation of distressed real estate assets (e.g., Mexico's "Remates Bancarios"). The system utilizes a distributed network of scrapers to ingest data from disparate sources, including banking portals, judicial gazettes, and auction house listings. A data normalization layer transforms unstructured legal descriptions and appraisal values into a standardized schema. The system features a geospatial analysis engine that cross-references asset locations with market data to estimate potential profit margins and risk factors. By providing a unified, searchable interface for assets traditionally siloed in fragmented government and financial databases, the system democratizes access to high-yield investment opportunities while providing advanced technical tools for institutional-grade due diligence.

Technical Field
===============
This disclosure relates to the field of Real Estate Technology (PropTech), automated data aggregation, and financial analysis systems for distressed assets.

Background & Problem Statement
==============================
Bank foreclosures (remates bancarios) represent a significant market for real estate investors. However, the information regarding these assets is notoriously fragmented. Banks publish lists in PDFs or obscure web portals, while judicial auctions are often only disclosed in physical or digital gazettes with archaic formatting. This lack of transparency creates an information asymmetry where only a few "insider" buyers can effectively track and evaluate opportunities. Furthermore, calculating the actual value of a foreclosure requires crossing legal data with current market prices, a task that is difficult to perform at scale.

Detailed Description
====================


Specific Embodiments
====================
In one embodiment, the system includes a "Predictive Auction Bot" that analyzes historical winning bids in specific courts to estimate the likely final price of a judicial auction, helping investors set their maximum bid.

Claims of Novelty
=================
The system claims novelty in the combination of multi-source automated legal/banking data ingestion with real-time market comparative analysis specifically designed for the evaluation of distressed real estate assets, providing a technical solution to information fragmentation in the foreclosure market.
