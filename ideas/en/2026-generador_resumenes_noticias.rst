Abstract
========
An automated news intelligence system designed to provide high-fidelity summaries of regional and sector-specific news. The system utilize a distributed ingestion engine to monitor a vast array of media sources, including newspapers, digital portals, government newsrooms, and social media feeds. A semantic clustering layer employs NLP to identify "Core Stories" reported across multiple outlets, ensuring deduplication. The system features a "Multi-Perspective Synthesizer" (LLM) that extracts the key factual points of a story while identifying and neutralizing editorial bias. By delivering a "Executive Briefing" (e.g., a 5-minute summary) tailored to a user's specific industry or geographic interests, the system enables decision-makers to stay informed of critical local developments with minimal time investment.

Technical Field
===============
This disclosure relates to the field of Information Retrieval, automated journalism (NewsTech), and NLP-driven content summarization.

Background & Problem Statement
==============================
The modern media landscape is fragmented and overwhelming. A corporate director or business owner needs to know what is happening in their city (e.g., "New local tax," "Road closures," "Competitor expansion") but doesn't have time to read 20 different newspapers. Furthermore, news is often repetitive and filled with political bias or clickbait. There is a need for a system that acts as a "Personal Editor," filtering out the noise and delivering only the "Golden Nuggets" of information that actually impact the business.

Detailed Description
====================


Specific Embodiments
====================
In one embodiment, the system includes a "Sentiment Impact Score" that analyzes if a news event is likely to have a positive or negative impact on a specific industry (e.g., "New Highway" is `Positive` for `Logistics`).

Claims of Novelty
=================
The system claims novelty in the combination of cross-source semantic clustering with fact-grounded LLM summarization specifically designed to generate "Executive Briefings" from fragmented regional news sources.
