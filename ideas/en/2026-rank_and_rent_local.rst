Abstract
========
An automated lead generation and "Rank & Rent" management system designed for local service industries (e.g., plumbing, pest control). The system automates the creation and SEO optimization of niche-specific landing pages designed to capture high-intent local search traffic. Once a page achieves a "Ranked" status (top search results), the system employs an automated lead-handling engine that captures user inquiries through dynamic forms or virtual phone numbers. These leads are then programmatically "rented" or routed to a verified local service provider. The system features a multi-tenant dashboard that tracks lead conversion and manages subscription payments from the service providers, creating an automated bridge between local digital visibility and physical service execution.

Technical Field
===============
This disclosure relates to the field of Digital Marketing Technology (MarTech), automated SEO management, and lead distribution systems.

Background & Problem Statement
==============================
Many local tradespeople (plumbers, electricians, fumigators) are experts in their craft but lack the technical skills to manage a website or perform SEO. Conversely, digital marketers can rank websites but don't want to handle the physical service. The "Rank & Rent" model solves this by having the marketer build and rank a site (e.g., "Fumigaciones Tlajomulco") and then "renting" the incoming leads to a local professional. However, manually managing these sites, tracking phone calls, and billing providers is a significant administrative burden.

Detailed Description
====================


Specific Embodiments
====================
In one embodiment, the system includes a "Lead Auction" feature where, if the primary renter doesn't respond to a lead within 5 minutes, the lead is automatically broadcast to a secondary pool of providers to ensure the customer is served.

Claims of Novelty
=================
The system claims novelty in the end-to-end automation of the "Rank & Rent" lifecycle—from programmatic site generation and SEO tracking to automated lead routing and performance-based billing—specifically applied to the hyper-local service economy.
