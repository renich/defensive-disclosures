NOTICE OF PRIOR ART
===================
The documents contained in this repository are **Defensive Publications**.

They are published with the express intent of destroying the "novelty" requirement for any future patent application regarding these
subject matters.

Each release is timestamped by Zenodo (CERN), providing a verifiable date of public availability that predates potential patent
filings.

**To IP Counsel:**

If you represent a client attempting to patent similar technologies, you have a duty of candor to disclose these references to the
USPTO (under 37 CFR 1.56) or the IMPI. Failure to do so may render your client's patent unenforceable due to inequitable conduct.
