.. note::
   This document constitutes a Defensive Publication. It discloses technical mechanisms to prevent patenting of the described
   methods by establishing prior art.

Abstract
========
..
   (English) Write a 150-word summary focusing purely on the technical function.
   Example: "A disclosed system comprising a central server, a plurality of user
   mobile devices, and a geospatial database configured to..."

Resumen Técnico (Abstract in Spanish)
=====================================
..
   (Español) Essential for validity in Mexico (IMPI). Translate the technical
   abstract above accurately.

Technical Field
===============
..
   State the industry clearly.
   Example: "This disclosure relates to the field of mobile application servers,
   specifically real-time data synchronization and geolocation algorithms."

Background & Problem Statement
==============================
..
   Describe the technical problem, not the market need. Focus on efficiency,
   latency, or functionality failures in current systems.

Detailed Description (The Enablement)
=====================================
..
   CRITICAL: You must describe the system so a programmer could build it.

System Architecture
-------------------
..
   "The system consists of Module A talking to Database B via API C..."

Process Flow
------------
..
   1. User input is hashed using SHA-256...
   2. Server compares hash against lookup table...

Specific Embodiments
====================
..
   Give concrete examples. "In one embodiment, the matching algorithm
   prioritizes users within a 5km radius..."

Claims of Novelty
=================
..
   Explicitly state what is new. "Unlike existing solution X, this method
   utilizes [unique variable] to determine..."
